My little cookbook.

# Notes
You'll see exclamation marks in some places, this is so i don't get tablespoon and tea spoon mixed up.... it happens a lot
If another recipe is mentioned like doughs you'll see the use of U as the ammount, this is in units of the recipe supplied. 1U is one of the mentioned ingredients, 2U means you double the recipe.
